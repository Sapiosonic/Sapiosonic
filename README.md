## Hi, Welcome To My Page!

My name is Radam√©s, astudent from Brazil who's nowadays enrolled in an Associate degree on Internet based Systems. I've just finished a 6 months in depth on-campus training on Web Development with Angular in the client-side and Java powered by Spring Boot in the server-side.

Also, I'm a student in StartSe Tech Academy, an online 3 months training covering Javascript fundamentals, Front-end fundamentals, Node.js fundamentals and SQL.

In this Github profile you can find a preview of what I've learned so far and what kind of programming languages and related technologies I'm interested in.

If you want to keep in touch, feel free to reach me out on my social medias.
